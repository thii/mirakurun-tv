# Local Signing and Apple TV Install (No Secrets in Git)

## Goal
Configure Apple Team Name/ID locally for signing and install to your Apple TV without committing those values.

## Local-Only Files
- `config/Signing.local.xcconfig` (gitignored)
- `.local/apple-tv.env` (gitignored)

These are generated by:

```bash
./scripts/configure-local-signing.sh --team-id <TEAM_ID> --team-name "<TEAM_NAME>" --device "<APPLE_TV_NAME_OR_UDID>"
```

Optional:
- `--bundle-id <BUNDLE_ID>` if your local bundle id differs.

## One-Time Setup
1. Generate local signing and deploy config:

```bash
./scripts/configure-local-signing.sh \
  --team-id ABCDE12345 \
  --team-name "My Apple Team" \
  --device "Living Room Apple TV"
```

2. (If needed) install VLC dependency:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-tvvlckit.sh
```

## Build, Install, Launch on Apple TV

```bash
./scripts/install-to-apple-tv.sh
```

This script will:
- run `xcodegen generate`
- build with automatic signing for the configured Team ID
- install the app to your Apple TV using `devicectl`
- launch the app on device

## Inspect Connected Devices

```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices
```

Use either Apple TV name or UDID as `--device` value.
